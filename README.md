# Fake vs Real Voice Classification Project

## Project Structure

### Objective
- Develop a machine learning model to classify real and synthetic voices.
- Focus on feature extraction and model training for high accuracy on unseen test data.

### Summary
- Used the Fake or Real (FoR) dataset with balanced real and synthetic voice samples.
- Extracted audio features including MFCC, Spectrogram, Chroma, and Timbre features.
- Trained and evaluated models like SVM, MLP, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- Achieved 81.16% accuracy on the test set with SVM using MFCC + BHDR features.

### Dataset
- **Fake or Real (FoR)**: 17,870 2-second audio clips, balanced across gender and voice types.
- **Source Data**:
  - Real: Arctic, LJSpeech, VoxForge, TED Talks.
  - Synthetic: Deep Voice 3, Google TTS, Wavenet, etc.

### Feature Extraction
- **MFCC**: Captures timbral and spectral characteristics of audio.
- **Timbre Features**: Includes brightness, hardness, depth, and roughness.
- **Spectrogram**: Time-frequency representation of audio.
- **Chroma and Spectral Contrast**: Captures tonal and harmonic information.

### Experimental Setup
- Models used: Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, SVM, MLP, and XGBoost.
- 5-fold cross-validation for robust evaluation.
- Feature combinations tested for optimal performance.

### Results
- Best Feature Combination: MFCC + BHDR features with SVM (accuracy: 81.84%).
- Individual Features: MFCC and Spectrogram showed strong performance (>75%).
- External Testing: Performance dropped slightly due to high-quality unseen deepfake audio.

### Key Findings
- MFCC and BHDR features complement each other to distinguish synthetic voices.
- SVM with radial basis function kernel demonstrated superior generalizability.
- Challenges remain with high-quality synthetic voices generated by modern AI systems.

### Future Work
- Explore deep learning models for end-to-end feature extraction and classification.
- Incorporate larger datasets with newer deepfake audio techniques.
